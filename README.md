## Quick Start

Run the full stack locally.
See [Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed setup.

1. **Install dependencies:**

   npm run install:all
   ```

2. **Start the App (Frontend & API):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Start the Worker (in a new terminal):**
   *Note: Requires Docker to be running.*
   ```bash
   cd worker && npm run dev
   ```

Visit **http://localhost:5173** to start simulating.
