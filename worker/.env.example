# Worker .env — auto-generated by scripts/setup-worker.sh
#
# You should NOT need to create this manually. Instead:
#   1. Run the "Provision Worker" GitHub Actions workflow (syncs secrets to GCP Secret Manager)
#   2. Run: ./scripts/setup-worker.sh
#
# The setup script reads from Secret Manager and writes this file automatically.
# Worker runtime config (API_URL, WORKER_SECRET, etc.) comes from Secret Manager at startup.
#
# If you need to override or aren't using setup-worker.sh, you can set values manually:

# Host-level Docker Compose config (used by docker-compose.yml, NOT by the worker process)
# SA_KEY_PATH=./sa.json
# IMAGE_NAME=ghcr.io/tytaniumdev/magicbracketsimulator/worker
# GHCR_USER=your-github-username
# GHCR_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

# GCP (optional — worker also reads from "gcloud config get-value project")
# GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="magic-bracket-simulator"
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/worker-key.json"

# Worker runtime overrides (loaded from Secret Manager by default):
# PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION="job-created-worker"
# GCS_BUCKET="magic-bracket-simulator-artifacts"
# API_URL="https://api-xxxxx-uc.a.run.app"
# WORKER_SECRET="your-shared-secret"
# JOBS_DIR="./jobs"
# POLL_INTERVAL_MS=3000

# Optional worker identifier (for multi-machine setups)
# WORKER_ID="my-mac-mini"
