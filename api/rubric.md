# Bracket Rubric (Official Beta Guidance - October 2025)

Use this rubric to assign a power bracket (1-5) to each Commander deck based on decklists and game outcomes.

## Bracket Definitions

- **Bracket 1 (Exhibition)**: Expect to play **9+ turns** before win/loss. Decks prioritize theme and flavor over power. Win conditions are thematic and substandard.

- **Bracket 2 (Core)**: Expect to play **8+ turns** before win/loss. Unoptimized and straightforward. Win conditions are incremental, telegraphed, and disruptable.

- **Bracket 3 (Upgraded)**: Expect to play **6+ turns** before win/loss. Powered up with strong synergy and high card quality. Can deploy win conditions in one big turn from accrued resources.

- **Bracket 4 (Optimized)**: Expect to play **4+ turns** before win/loss. Lethal, consistent, and fast. Features efficient tutors, fast mana, and high-efficiency disruption.

- **Bracket 5 (cEDH)**: Game could end on **any turn**. Meticulously designed for the competitive metagame with razor-thin margins for error.

## Key Signals to Look For

**Game Changers** (cards that indicate higher brackets when present):
- Fast mana: Sol Ring, Mana Crypt, Mana Vault, Chrome Mox, Mox Diamond, Lion's Eye Diamond, Ancient Tomb, Grim Monolith
- Efficient tutors: Demonic Tutor, Vampiric Tutor, Imperial Seal, Mystical Tutor, Enlightened Tutor, Worldly Tutor, Gamble
- Free spells: Force of Will, Fierce Guardianship
- Value engines: Rhystic Study, Smothering Tithe, Necropotence, Consecrated Sphinx, Seedborn Muse
- Powerful cards: Cyclonic Rift, Ad Nauseam, Thassa's Oracle, Underworld Breach

**Win Speed**: The average turn a deck wins on is the primary bracket indicator.
**Consistency**: Low variance in winning turns indicates a more optimized deck.
**Win Rate**: Higher win rate suggests the deck may be above the table's power level.
