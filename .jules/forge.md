# Forge's Journal

## Critical Learnings
- **[2024-03-24]**: Initialized `AGENTS.md` as the SSOT for intent. Confirmed CI workflows (`ci.yml`, `deploy.yml`) use standard `npm ci` commands, but were missing tests for `analysis-service`, `forge-log-analyzer`, and build check for `local-worker`. Added parity scripts and updated CI.
