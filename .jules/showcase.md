## UX Friction Points

*   **Missing Contributing Guide:** Users looking to contribute have no clear entry point. A basic `CONTRIBUTING.md` was created, but it needs more specific details.
*   **Deployment Info Clutter:** Deployment instructions were mixed with local run instructions, making the "Quick Start" hard to find. These have been moved to `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Fixes Applied

*   **Broken Links:** Replaced relative link for "Report Bug" with absolute GitHub URL to ensure it works from any context (e.g. forks, mirrors).
*   **Hero Image:** Generated and added a real screenshot (`docs/images/hero-screenshot.png`) to replace the placeholder, significantly improving "Curb Appeal".
