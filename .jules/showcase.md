# Showcase Journal

## UX Friction Points

*   **Missing Contributing Guide:** Users looking to contribute have no clear entry point. A basic `CONTRIBUTING.md` was created, but it needs more specific details.
*   **Deployment Info Clutter:** Deployment instructions were mixed with local run instructions, making the "Quick Start" hard to find. These have been moved to `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Fixes Applied

*   **Broken Links:** Replaced relative link for "Report Bug" with absolute GitHub URL to ensure it works from any context (e.g. forks, mirrors).
*   **Hero Image:** Generated and added a real screenshot (`docs/images/hero-screenshot.png`) to replace the placeholder, significantly improving "Curb Appeal".
*   **Root Clutter:** Moved `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MODE_SETUP.md`, and `GCP_MIGRATION_FIX_PLAN.md` to `docs/` to keep the root clean and focused on the "Landing Page" experience.
*   **Golden Template Alignment:** Reordered `README.md` to strictly follow the "Golden Template" (Title -> Links -> Badges -> Hook -> Hero Visual).
*   **Internal Link Repair:** Updated `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to reflect the new file locations.
*   **Header Organization:** The "Critical Link Array" and badges were visually disjointed. Combined them into a centered header block with high-quality "Tech Stack" badges to improve "Curb Appeal".
