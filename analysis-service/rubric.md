# Bracket Rubric (Official Beta Guidance)

Use this rubric to assign a power bracket (1-5) to Commander decks based on game outcomes and behavior.

- **Bracket 1 (Exhibition)**: Turn 9+ wins. Prioritizes theme and flavor over power.
- **Bracket 2 (Core)**: Turn 8+ wins. Unoptimized, straightforward, and social.
- **Bracket 3 (Upgraded)**: Turn 6+ wins. Powered up with strong synergy and effective disruption.
- **Bracket 4 (Optimized)**: Turn 4+ wins. Lethal, consistent, and fast; features high-efficiency disruption and tutors.
- **Bracket 5 (cEDH)**: Any turn wins. Meticulously designed for the competitive metagame.
